# FreeBuddhistAudio Android app

An Android client for freebuddhistaudio.com.

Current status: **borked** (search works, downloading and playback mostly works, lots of bugs)

TODOs include:

- Fix current breaking bugs
- Nicer home screen
- Android Auto

Bugs/enhancements:

- Delete from downloaded talk talk details
- No progress bar for audio playback
- No track list on talk details screen and playback
- Downloaded talks not working
- Backend returning dodgy track lists, so we need to fetch from a different URL
- No easy way to get home
- No show me the latest sort of thing
- No Download progress visible, buggy downloads
- Android Auto
- When playing audio, the play controls need to be visible on all pages
- Can the playing audio be integrated into android so that it shows the audio controls on the lock screen?
