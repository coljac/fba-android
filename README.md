# FreeBuddhistAudio Android app

An Android client for freebuddhistaudio.com.

Current status: **borked** (search works, downloading and playback mostly works, lots of bugs)

TODOs include:

- Fix current breaking bugs
- Nicer home screen
- Android Auto

Bugs/enhancements:
- No progress bar for audio playback
- Download button doesn't change to downloading...
- Download causes playback
- Delete from downloaded talk "talk details" page
- No track list on talk details screen and playback
- Downloaded talks not working
- Backend returning dodgy track lists, so we need to fetch from a different URL
- No easy way to get home
- No Download progress visible, buggy downloads
- Can the playing audio be integrated into android so that it shows the audio controls on the lock screen?
- Icon and headings
- Rename from FreeAudio to Free Buddhist Audio
- Show me the latest sort of thing on home
- Android Auto
